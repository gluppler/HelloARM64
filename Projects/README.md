# Projects Portfolio

This directory contains standalone ARM64 assembly projects demonstrating real-world applications and advanced implementations.

## Portfolio Projects

Each project in this directory is a complete, standalone implementation showcasing ARM64 assembly expertise. **Projects are NOT numerically labelled** and represent independent portfolio pieces that demonstrate real-world problem-solving and implementation skills.

## Project Structure

Projects should be organized by category or functionality, with each project containing:
- Source code (`.s` files)
- Documentation (README.md)
- Build instructions
- Example usage
- Clear demonstration of ARM64 assembly concepts

## Portfolio Organization

Projects are organized as standalone pieces, not as part of a numbered sequence. Each project should:
- Have a descriptive, meaningful name (no numerical prefixes)
- Be self-contained and independently buildable
- Demonstrate specific ARM64 assembly techniques or solve real problems
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Follow industry best practices and quality standards

## Adding Projects

When adding a new project to the portfolio:

1. **Create a descriptive directory name** (no numerical prefixes)
   - Good: `Matrix_Multiplier`, `String_Processor`, `Cryptographic_Hash`
   - Avoid: `01_Project`, `02_Project`, etc.

2. **Include comprehensive documentation**
   - README.md explaining the project
   - What problem it solves
   - What ARM64 techniques it demonstrates
   - Build and usage instructions

3. **Ensure code follows industry best practices**
   - Production-ready, error-free implementations
   - Comprehensive security best practices
   - All memory accesses properly validated
   - All instructions correctly formatted
   - Well-structured, maintainable code
   - Input validation and bounds checking throughout
   - All code must compile and execute without errors

4. **Provide clear build and usage instructions**
   - How to compile
   - How to run
   - Expected output
   - Dependencies (if any)

## Project Categories

Projects can be organized by:
- **Application Domain**: System utilities, algorithms, data processing
- **Technique Focus**: Optimization, security, performance
- **Complexity Level**: Beginner-friendly, intermediate, advanced
- **Platform**: Linux-specific, Apple Silicon-specific, cross-platform

## Portfolio Showcase

Each project in this directory serves as a portfolio piece demonstrating:
- **Technical Skills**: ARM64 assembly proficiency
- **Problem-Solving**: Real-world application development
- **Code Quality**: Production-ready implementations
- **Documentation**: Clear, comprehensive project documentation
