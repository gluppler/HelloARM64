# Design Principles

## Core Principles

### 1. No Abstraction
- Direct ARM64 assembly
- No high-level abstractions
- Understand actual instructions

### 2. Reference-Based
- All concepts cited
- Traceable to official docs
- No uncited knowledge

### 3. Practical Focus
- Real, working code
- Buildable projects
- Practical applications

### 4. Progressive Learning
- Start simple, build complexity
- Each lesson builds on previous
- Clear learning path

### 5. Complete Materialization
- No placeholders
- Full implementations
- Working examples

## Code Quality

### Standards
- ABI-compliant
- Well-commented
- Error handling
- Security-conscious

### Best Practices
- Stack alignment
- Register preservation
- Memory safety
- Performance awareness

## Documentation

### Requirements
- Clear explanations
- Architectural reasoning
- Reference citations
- Build instructions

### Style
- Consistent format
